The system follows a server–client architecture.
The backend server (FastAPI) acts as the intelligence and orchestration layer, while the ETTA-X UI (Electron/Web dashboard) is only a visualization and control interface. Closing the UI does not affect background processing.
ETTA-X integrates with GitHub using OAuth and webhooks. Once a repository is connected, the system remains idle until a code change event (push or pull request) occurs. When triggered, ETTA-X performs incremental diagnosis using git diff and AST parsing only on changed files, avoiding full repository rescans and unnecessary computation.
The detected changes are passed to an Impact Analysis Engine, which identifies affected APIs, routes, and UI components. Based on this impact, ETTA-X uses an LLM-based test generation layer to automatically create relevant API and UI test cases. A test prioritization engine then ranks tests using historical failures, risk, and coverage to ensure efficient CI execution.
Test execution is handled via CI/CD pipelines and remains fully deterministic. Post-execution, ETTA-X applies self-healing logic to repair broken UI locators and uses ML-based failure analytics to cluster failures and detect flaky test
